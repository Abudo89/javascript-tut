     //JavaScript variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and 
     /* then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
     Before you use a variable in a Javascript program, you must declare it.
     Variables are declared with the 'var' keyword as follows:
     var money;
     var name;
     you can also declare multiple variables with the same var keywordas follows:
     var money, name;
     storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization. You can do variable initialization at the
     time of variable creation or at a later point in time when you need that variable.
